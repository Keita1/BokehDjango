# Bokeh Server using Django Tutorial
The intention of this project is to list all of the steps neessary to run static Bokeh plots and interactive
Bokeh Server plots on the Django web framework.

It includes instructions necessary to launch on a production server.  I used Linode, but the instructions should be
generic enough to extend to other hosting platforms.

##Requirements:
* Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
* Python 3.5.2

Step by Step instructions are located in the documentation folder in a file called Linode_Instructions.txt

## Attributes:
* Matthew Makai's book, "Full Stack Python Guide to Deployments", was very helpful with regards to providing a tutorial
to launch a hardened production server.

* The Bokeh Google Group, especially Bryan Van de Ven on the Anaconda team, helped whenever I had any problems or
questions. https://groups.google.com/a/continuum.io/forum/#!forum/bokeh
